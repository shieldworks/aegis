## Introduction

This section contains instructions to test and develop **Aegis** locally.

## Cloning Aegis Repositories

Create a workspace folder and clone **Aegis** into it.

After you clone `aegis`, pull its sister repositories too by executing
`./hack/pull.sh`

```bash 
mkdir $HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE
cd $HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE
git clone "https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis.git"
cd aegis
./hack/pull.sh
```

Now you should see these folders in your workspace:

```bash
cd $HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE
ls -al
aegis
aegis-core
aegis-safe
aegis-sdk-go
aegis-sentinel
aegis-sidecar
aegis-spire
aegis-web
aegis-workload-demo-using-sdk
aegis-workload-demo-using-sidecar
```

> **Creating a Pull Request**?
> 
> If you want to create a pull request you can replace the repositories
> that you are working on [with your forked repo][fork]. The rest of the
> workflow here should still work similarly.
> 
> If you are contributing to the source code, make sure you read
> [the contributing guidelines][contributing], and [the code of conduct][coc].

[fork]: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks
[contributing]: https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
[coc]: https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## Prerequisites

Other than the source code, you need the following set up for your development
environment to be able to locally develop **Aegis**:

* [Docker][docker] installed and running for the local user.
* [Minikube][minikube] installed on your system.
* [Make][make] installed on your system.

[minikube]: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/
[make]: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/

> **Can I Use Something Other than Minikube and Docker**?
> 
> Of course, you can use any Kubernetes cluster to develop, deploy, and test
> **Aegis**. 
> 
> Similarly, you can use any OCI-compliant container runtime. It does not
> have to be Docker.
>
> We are giving **Minikube** and **Docker** as an example because they are
> easier to set up; and when you stumble upon, it is easy to find supporting
> documentation about these to help you out. 
> 
> Additionally, it would be hard to keep the documentation updated for all 
> possible distros, clusters, and container runtimes.
> 
> Which means, for now at least, if you are not using **Minikube**, you are
> on you own üôÇ.

## Preparing Your Environment

The best way to test and develop **Aegis** right now is to use a **Minikube**
environment.

Make sure you have [Docker][docker] up and running. And then execute
the following.

```bash
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis
./hack/minikube-start.sh
```

[docker]: https://www.docker.com/

## Deploying Your Code to the Cluster

After you make your changes, you can run the following to build and deploy
the latest and the greatest:

```bash
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis

make sync
make build-local
make deploy-local
```

The [Makefile][makefile] contains other useful targets that you might want
to explore too.

For example, if you just want to build and deploy **Aegis Sidecar**, you 
can do:

```bash
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis

make build-sidecar-local
```

Or if you want to pull recent Kubernetes manifests, you can run:

```bash
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis

make sync
```

## Minikube Quirks

If you are using **Ubuntu**, it would be helpful to know that **Minikube** and
**snap** version of **Docker** do not play well together. If you are having
registry-related issues, or if you are not able to execute a `docker images`
without being the root user, then one resolution can be to remove the snap
version of docker and install it from the source:

```bash 
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | \ 
    sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

> **Restart Your System**
> 
> After doing this, you might need to restart your system and execute
> `minikube delete` on your terminal too. Although you might feel that this
> step is optional, it is **not**; trust me üôÇ.

After installing a non-snap version of **Docker** and restarting your system, if 
you can use **Minikube** *Docker registry*, then, perfect. If not, there are
a few things that you might want to try. So if you are still having issues
keep on reading.

Before trying anything else, it might be worth giving [Docker Post Installation 
Steps][post-installation] from the official Docker website a shot. Following
that guideline **may** solve Docker-related permission issues that you might
still be having.

> **Restart, Maybe?**
> 
> If you still have permission issues after following the official Docker post
> installation steps outlined above, try **restarting** your computer once more.
>
> Especially when it comes to Docker permissions, restarting can help, 
> and worst case it‚Äôs still worth giving a try.

[post-installation]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

Still no luck? Keep on reading.

Depending on your operating system, and the Minikube version that you use
it might take a while to find a way to push images to Minikube‚Äôs internal
Docker registry. [The relevant section about the Minikube handbook][minikube-push]
covers a lot of details, and can be helpful; however, it is also really easy 
skip or overlook certain steps.

If you have `docker push` issues, or you have problem your Kubernetes Pods 
acquiring images from the local registry, try these:

* Execute `eval $(minikube docker-env)` before pushing things to **Docker**. This
  is one of the first instructions [on the ‚Äú*push*‚Äù section of the Minikube
  handbook][minikube-push], yet it is still very easy to inadvertently skip it.
* Make sure you have the registry addon enabled (`minikube addons list`).
* You might have luck directly pushing the image: 
  `docker build --tag $(minikube ip):5000/test-img`; followed by:
  `docker push $(minikube ip):5000/test-img`.
* There are also `minikube image load` and `minikube image build` commands
  that might be helpful.

## Enjoy üéâ

Just explore the [Makefile][makefile] and get a feeling of it.

recommendations.
