## What Is **Aegis**?

[**Aegis**][aegis] is a **Kubernetes-native**, lightweight secrets manager 
that keeps your secrets secret. With **Aegis**, you can rest assured 
that your sensitive data is always **secure** and **protected**. 

**Aegis** is perfect for securely storing arbitrary configuration information at a 
central location and securely dispatching it to workloads.

By leveraging Kubernetes security primitives, [**SPIRE**][spire], and strong,
industry-standard encryption, **Aegis** ensures that your secrets are **only** 
accessible to **trusted** and **authorized** workloads. **Aegis**‚Äôs 
Cloud Native‚Äîsecure by default‚Äîfoundation helps you safeguard your business 
and protect against data breaches.

[Check out **Aegis**‚Äôs *GitHub* for details][aegis-github].

## See **Aegis** in Action

If you haven‚Äôt watched this introductory video yet, now might be a good time üôÇ.

After watching it, you may want to watch the following video demonstrates 
further flexibility of **Aegis** as a *Secrets Manager*:

## Wait, Why Not Use Kubernetes `Secret`s?

In Kubernetes, secrets can be stored and managed as a resource type called
`Secret`. By default, Kubernetes can store key-value pairs
of sensitive data within a specific namespace in the cluster.

These secrets can be fed into containers as either *environment variables*
or files using a Kubernetes *volume*. However, the default solution may not be
enough to securely manage secrets, as it can be challenging to encrypt the
`YAML` files that define the secrets and securely store them.

With **Aegis**, you don‚Äôt have to store secrets in your source code.

In addition, **Aegis**‚Ä¶

* Has the ability to change secrets dynamically at runtime without having to
  reboot your workloads,
* Keeps encrypted backups of your secrets,
* Records last creation and last update timestamps for your secrets,
* Has a version history for your secrets,
* Stores backups of your secrets encrypted at rest,
* and more.

These are not achievable by using Kubernetes `Secret`s only.

## Where **NOT** to Use Aegis

**Aegis** is **not** a Database, nor is it a distributed caching layer. Of course,
you may tweak it to act like one if you try hard enough, yet, that is
generally not a good use of the tool.

**Aegis** is suitable for storing secrets and dispatching them; however, it
is a *terrible* idea to use it as a centralized database to store everything
but the kitchen sink.

Use **Aegis** to store service keys, database credentials, access tokens,
etc.

## How Do I Get the Root Token? Where Do I Store It?

Unlike some other secret vaults, you do not need an admin token
to operate **Aegis** üôÇ.

Benefits of this approach is: It helps the Ops team `#sleepmore`, since
everything is automated, and you won‚Äôt have to manually unlock **Aegis** upon
a system crash, for example.

However, there‚Äôs no free lunch, and as the operator of a production system,
your homework is to secure access to your cluster. [Check out the **Production 
Deployment Guidelines**][production] for further instructions about hardening your 
cluster to securely use **Aegis**.

## Terminology: A Tale of Two Secrets

There are two kinds of secrets mentioned throughout this documentation:

* Secrets that are stored in **Aegis Safe**: When discussing these, they will
  be used like a regular word ‚Äúsecret‚Äù or, emphasized ‚Äú**secret**‚Äù; however,
  you will never see them in `monotype text`.
* The other kind of secret is Kubernetes `Secret` objects. Those types
  will be explicitly mentioned as ‚ÄúKubernetes `Secret`s‚Äù in the documentation.

We hope this will clarify any confusion going forward.

## Installation

First, ensure that you have sufficient administrative rights on your 
**Kubernetes** cluster. Then create a workspace folder 
(*such as `$HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE`*) and clone the project.
And finally execute `./hack/install.sh` as follows.

```bash 
mkdir $HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE
export $WORKSPACE=$HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE

cd $WORKSPACE

git clone https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis
cd aegis

./hack/install.sh
```

## Verifying Installation

To verify installation, check out the `aegis-system` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -n aegis-system

# Output:
#
# NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE
# aegis-safe       1/1     1            1
# aegis-sentinel   1/1     1            1
```

That‚Äôs it. You are all set ü§ò.

## Uninstalling Aegis

Uninstallation can be done by running a script:

```bash 
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis 
./hack/uninstall.sh
```
