TODO: convert these to actionable items in 2013!

To create secrets of any kind, the administrator will require the admin token.

To securely deliver the admin token to the administrator:

1. 
Safe will have an API to generate a private/public key pay.
Via that API, both the private key and the public key will be 
delivered to the admin to store them safely outside source control.
Private key in a safe medium; public key can be public.

This API will deliver the keypair only once. A second request will
result in an empty json response or some form of a 4xx error.

2. 
Safe will store the public key and the private key in memory.

3.
The admin can ask for the admin token, and Safe will return an encrypted
(with the public key) version of master key to the admin.

4. 
The admin will use a tool (that exists outside the cluster) to decrypt
the encrypted admin token to get their plain text admin token.

The admin then will need to store the (unencrypted) admin token safely too.

5.
Safe will store the encrypted versions of admin token and notary token on
a persistent volume.

6. 
Safe will periodically encrypt and store the secrets on that persistent 
volume too.

7. 
During (1) Safe will send the private key to Notary too.
Notary will then ''update'' a Kubernetes secret (that only it can access)
that stores the private key.
Securing that secret is important, and cluster administrators will 
be expected to provide proper RBAC for that. Only Notary shall be allowed
to read and write to that secret.

8. When notary crashes, it still has access to the secret and thus to the
private key so it can ask the encrypted notary token from Safe and decrypt it 
and store it in memory and life is back to normal.

9. When Safe crashes, Notary can bootstrap it again because it already has
the decrypted notary token in memory.

9.1. Then Notary can register all workloads with new workload id and workload
secrets.

9.2. Safe has crashed, but Safe still has the secrets in its PV in encrypted form. 
It needs the private key to decrypt them. During this (after-crash) bootstrapping, 
Notary can deliver the key that it knows to Safe. And Safe then can decrypt whatâ€™s 
on disk and store it in memory. And Safe is back to business too.

10. Since these interactions are in cluster they are moderately secure from
a practical standpoint. However, at phase 2 we'd better ensure that at 
least the private key and token exchanges are done through mTLS.

The x.509 certificates (for mTLS) can be autogenerated during deployment and 
stored as Secrets that are mounted to Safe and Notary.

Addenda:

A1. Since we are talking about two workloads only, rolling out a PKI with something
like SPIFFE will be an overkill. However, if SPIFFE/SPIRE already exists on 
the system, we can configure Aegis to leverage that too (instead of generating
their own x.509 certs).

A2. Key and certificate rotation is the top topic of a follow-up issue. 
Since Notary is the central orchestrator, it can coordinate key rotation too.
For example, it can send the new notary token to Safe and all workloads
and safe and workloads can cache past 2-3 notary tokens to be on the safe side.

Safe can automatically rotate the admin token and tell the admin that their 
token has expired; then admin will request their new encrypted token and decrypt
it with their private key as usual.

A3. Any API that the Admin executes can be triggered via CI (like Jenkins) too.
So this thing is fully automatable, and can be integrated with a GitOps pipeline
etc.
