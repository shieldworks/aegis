## Use Case: Leveraging Aegis SDK

This example demonstrates how to use **Aegis SDK** along with your workload.

When you use **Aegis SDK**, you can communicate with **Aegis Safe** directly
and fetch the secrets to your workload whenever you need them.

This approach provides a great deal of flexibility, enabling you to make 
customizations to your code as needed. While adding the **Aegis SDK** as a 
dependency may require some extra effort, it also opens up a range of
features and capabilities that will benefit your project in the long run.
