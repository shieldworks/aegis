## Aegis Workshop

This workshop is designed to help you get started with Aegis. It will walk you 
through the installation of Aegis and its components, and then demonstrate how 
to use Aegis to protect your secrets.

## A Video Is Worth a Lot of Words

[You can watch this demo video][video] as an shortened version of the workshop.

In the video, we use all the scripts and resource manifests you see in this
folder to demonstrate various **Aegis** use cases.
