## The Elevator Pitch

[**Aegis**](https://aegis.ist) is a delightfully-secure Kubernetes-native 
secrets store.

**Aegis** keeps your secrets secret.

With **Aegis**, you can rest assured that your
sensitive data is always **secure** and **protected**.

**Aegis** is perfect for securely storing arbitrary configuration information at
a central location and securely dispatching it to workloads.

## Tell Me More

**Aegis** is a cloud-native secure store for secrets management. 
It provides a minimal and intuitive API, ensuring practical security without 
compromising user experience. 

Aegis is **resilient** and **secure** by default, storing sensitive data in memory 
and encrypting any data saved to disk. 

Endorsed by industry experts, **Aegis** is a ground-up re-imagination of 
secrets management, leveraging SPIFFE for authentication and providing 
a cloud-native way to manage secrets end-to-end.

## Getting Your Hands Dirty

Before trying **Aegis**, you might want to learn about its 
[architecture][architecture] and [design goals][design].

Once you are ready to get started, [see the Quickstart guide][quickstart].

Or, if you one of those who ‚Äú*learn by doing*‚Äù, you might want to dig into the 
implementation details later. If that‚Äôs the case, you can directly jump to the 
fun part and [follow the steps here][installation] to install 
**Aegis** to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Status of This Software

**Aegis**, is under dynamic and progressive development.

The code that we‚Äôve officially signed and released maintains a 
high standard of stability and dependability. However, we do encourage 
it be used in a production environment (*at your own risk‚Äî[see LICENSE](LICENSE)*).

It‚Äôs important to note that, technically speaking, **Aegis** currently holds the 
status of an alpha software. This simply means that as we journey towards our milestone of 
`v1.0.0`, it's possible for changes to occur‚Äîboth major and minor. While this might mean 
some aspects are not backward compatible, it's a testament to our unwavering commitment 
to refining and enhancing **Aegis**.

In a nutshell, we are ceaselessly pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible, while 
ensuring our software stays as dependable and effective for production use.
