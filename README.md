## Status of This Software

This project is a **work in progress** (*WIP*) and has yet to be ready for 
production consumption. **Use it at your own risk**.

## About Aegis

**Aegis** is a Kubernetes-native, lightweight, secrets management solution that 
keeps your secrets secret. 

With **Aegis**, you can rest assured that your 
sensitive data is always **secure** and **protected**. 

**Aegis** is perfect for securely storing arbitrary configuration information at a 
central location and securely dispatching it to workloads.

**Aegis** ensures that your secrets are only accessible to authorized workloads, 
helping you safeguard your business and protect against data breaches.

If you haven‚Äôt watched [this six-minute introductory video][aegis-demo-video] yet,
now might be a good time üôÇ.

## System Requirements

**Aegis** has been recently tested with the following Kubernetes version:

```text
Client Version: v1.26.0
Kustomize Version: v4.5.7
Server Version: v1.25.3
```

Although not explicitly tested, any recent Kubernetes installation will 
likely work just fine.

As in any secrets management solution, your compute and memory requirements
will depend on several factors, such as:

* The number of workloads in the cluster
* The number of secrets **Safe** (*Aegis‚Äô Secrets Store*) has to manage (*see [architecture details](ARCHITECTURE.md)*)
* The amount of workloads interacting with **Safe** (*see [architecture details](ARCHITECTURE.md)*)
* **Sidecar** poll frequency (*see [architecture details](ARCHITECTURE.md)*)
* etc.

We recommend you benchmark with a realistic production-like
cluster and allocate your resources accordingly.

## Installation

You need a **Kubernetes** cluster and sufficient admin rights on that cluster to
install **Aegis**.

As of now, the only installation option is to clone the project and install
it using `make` as follows:

```bash 
# Pick a workspace folder. Everything will be cloned here.
cd $WORKSPACE

# Clone the repo and cd into it:
git clone https://github.com/zerotohero-dev/aegis.git

# Switch to aegis project where we‚Äôll execute all other makefiles.
cd aegis

# Clean former deployment, if any:
make clean

# Install SPIRE, Safe, and Sentinel:
make deploy

# Optionally, install a demo workload to test the system:
make demo-sidecar

# Or try a demo workload that uses the Aegis Go SDK (w/o a sidecar):
make demo-sdk
```

To verify installation check out the `aegis-system` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -n aegis-system

# Output:
#
# NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE
# aegis-safe       1/1     1            1
# aegis-sentinel   1/1     1            1
```

## For Repo Admins

```bash 
# To clone repos into workspace:
make clone

# To reset the repos in the workspace:
make rimraf
make clone

# Pull changes
make pull

# Version bump (to build new container images)
make bump

# Rest of the build process is similar:
make build
make deploy
make demo-sidecar
make demo-sdk

# Tag a new release when you are sure everything works.
make tag
```

## Registering a Secret to a Workload

You can use **Sentinel** to add a secret to a workload:

```bash
# Change `aegis-sentinel-aabbccdd11223344` with the name of the Sentinel
# pod.
kubectl exec -it aegis-sentinel-aabbccdd11223344 -n aegis-system \
-- /bin/sentinel \ 
-w demo-workload # Name of the workload \
-s '{"username":"root@admin-db", \
"password":"KeepYourSecrets!."}' # The secret to bind to the workload.
```

**Sentinel** is the only entry point that an operator can register secrets
to the system.

## How Do I Get the Root Token? Where Do I Store It?

Unlike some other secret vaults, you do not need an admin token
to operate Aegis üôÇ.

Benefits of this approach is: It helps the Ops team `#sleepmore`, since 
everything is automated, and you won‚Äôt have to manually unlock Aegis upon 
a system crash, for example.

However, there‚Äôs no free lunch, and as the operator of a production system, 
your homework is to secure access to **Sentinel**.

**Aegis** leverages Kubernetes security primitives and modern cryptography 
to secure access to secrets. And **Sentinel** is the **only** system part that 
has direct write access to the secrets store. Therefore, once you secure your 
access to**Sentinel** with proper RBAC and policies, you secure your access 
to your secrets.

We believe that this approach is **Kubernetes-native**, convenient, simpler, 
and delightfully secure (*as opposed to being ‚Äúannoyingly secure‚Äù*).

## Design Decisions

Keeping *Aegis*, **Kubernetes-native**, **slim**, **secure**, and 
**boringly-easy** to install and operate are the pillars of the project.

[Check out the **Design Decisions** document](DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) for a 
deeper discussion about how we maintain the architectural balance in **Aegis**.

## Where **Not** To Use Aegis

Aegis is **not** a Database, nor is it a distributed caching layer. Of course,
you may tweak it to act like one if you try hard enough, yet, that is
generally not a good use of the tool.

Aegis is suitable for storing secrets and dispatching them; however, it
is a *terrible* idea to use it as a centralized database to store everything
but the kitchen sink.

Use Aegis to store service keys, database credentials, access tokens,
etc. 

## Technologies Used

Without these technologies, implementing **Aegis** would have been a very 
hard, time-consuming, and error-prone endeavor. 

* [SPIFFE and SPIRE][spire] for establishing an Identity Control Plane.
* [Netshoot][netshoot] for creating the ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù version of **Sentinel**.
* [Mozilla Sops][sops] (*in design phase*) to enable integration with cloud 
  secrets stores, such as AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure KeyVault, and even HashiCorp 
  Vault.
* [Age Encryption][age] (*in design phase*) to enable out-of-memory encrypted 
  backup of the secrets store for disaster recovery.

## One More Thing‚Ä¶ How Do I Pronounce ‚ÄúAegis‚Äù?

‚ÄúAegis‚Äù is a word of Greek origin and is pronounced `EE-jiss`.

[Here‚Äôs a YouTube pronunciation guide][pronounce].

[pronounce]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4bUgXWdNfM

**Aegis** has two definitions:

1. (Classical Mythology) The shield or breastplate of Zeus or Athena, bearing
   at its center the head of the Gorgon.
2. Protection; support.

Here‚Äôs an image of an aegis (*shield*) as depicted in Greek mythology:

## What‚Äôs Coming Up Next?

You can see the project‚Äôs progress [in this **Aegis MDP** board][mdp].

The board outlines what are the current outstanding work items, and what is
currently being worked on.

There is also [this **Aegis v1.0.0** board][v100] that contains longer-term
goals that we‚Äôll start once the MDP board is mostly done.

There is also [a text file](aegis.txt) that is a more free-form list of
issues. I sometimes jot things down there before creating more detailed GitHub
issues.
